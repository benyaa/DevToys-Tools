## JSONSchema Validator
This is a simple tool to validate JSON objects/files against JSON schemas.
It uses [NJsonSchema](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NJsonSchema) as the underlying library for the JSON schema validation so it supports whatever schemas it supports(draft v4+).

## JSONSchema Generator

## JSONSchema Class Generator
